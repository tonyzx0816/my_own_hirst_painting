This Python project creates a digital artwork inspired by Damien Hirst's spot paintings. It uses the 'turtle' graphics library to draw colorful dots in a grid pattern.

How it works

The script draws a grid of colored dots. It uses a predefined list of colors and randomly chooses one for each dot. The 'turtle' library handles the drawing.
